      ","Each mineral commodity chapter of the 2025 edition of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Commodity Summaries (MCS) includes information on events, trends, and issues for each mineral commodity. Additionally, there is introductory material that provides an overview of events, trends, and issues of the mineral industry as a whole. The data used for the tables and figures of this introductory material have been converted to a csv format as part of the Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025 Data Release. Subjects include industry employment and earnings, total mine production, downstream manufacturing production indexes, capacity utilization. Economic data are also provided for industries that use nonfuel mineral commodities, such as housing, vehicle sales, and highway construction. There is a State table showing value and rank for the mineral industries on a geographic basis.Another table provides net import reliance for those mineral commodities for which the United States is the most dependent on a supply of imports. A special critical minerals table provides additional information on U.S and world production and apparent consumption.",Companion data for graphs and figures of the introductory material in Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
